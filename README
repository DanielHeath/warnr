Warnr
======

Warnr builds on the power of Rails 3 validations.
It lets you use validations to identify situations which are warnings rather than errors.
It also lets you define a callback on the model which is executed after a validation warning/error is detected.

Todo: Modify callback to trigger after a record is saved with a warning.

NOTE: This is a spike. There are no tests or guarantees that it works or anything.
The whole thing is only 70 lines (half is redefining valid? to add one line in the middle - euch!).
You could probably rewrite it (with tests) in an hour or so if you used the current code as a reference point.

This should work with any rails 3 validation (not just activerecord) that doesn't override the 'valid?' method.

Usage Example
=======

class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Notify the client manager that the ABN has not been set
  belongs_to :manager, :foreign_key => "manager_id", :class_name => "User"    
  validates_presence_of :abn
  when_validation_fails(:treat_as_warnings => [:abn]) do |client|
    if client.errors.empty?
      MissingDataNotifier.missing_data_notification(client.manager, client).deliver
      # Will save the record in a week, which will trigger this process again.
      DelayedJob.create(1.week, Client, client.id, :save)
    end
  end
end
